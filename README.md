# SLS for large buildings

This repository contains the code for my SIT314 project submission, pertaining to an IoT smart lighting solution for large buildings.

## Getting Started

To run the simulated network, you will need `node` installed.

```bash
npm install

# simulators
npm run coordinator # coordinator interface available at http://localhost:3001
npm run hub
npm run light
```

To run the web app, simply run `app/index.html` in your browser.

###### Warning

This project is not production ready. It is a proof of concept only.
Things are likely to break.
